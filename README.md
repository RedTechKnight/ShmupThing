# A Shmup Thing

A small shmup thing I made.

Coded in C++. Uses OpenGL (with the GL Extension Wrangler) for graphics, SDL2 for window management and input handling, SDL2_Mixer for audio, SDL2_TTF for font rendering, AssImp for model loading and FreeImage for image loading.

Still very much a Work in progress, additional features and improvements inbound.
