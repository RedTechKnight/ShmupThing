# A Shmup Thing

A small shmup thing I made.

Coded in C++. Uses OpenGL (with the GL Extension Wrangler) for graphics, OpenGL Mathematics for the relevant mathematical functions, SDL2 for window management and input handling, SDL2_Mixer for audio, SDL2_TTF for font rendering, AssImp for model loading and FreeImage for image loading.

Still very much incomplete.
